# Notes
- Think shouldn't leash?
- Can't contest prio lvl 1 unless alistar flash pulv anyway though?
- 3:38 - 6 stack rend doesn't kill. Miss kill on Morg because of no reset.
- 16:32 - Not paying attention to Alistar position so I have to flash to 1for2 the Draven bounty like some sort idiot bastard.
- 18:32 - For some reason I literally just don't even hit the 15% hp Morgana before she flashes. Something's mentally wrong with me.
- 35:10 - I let Trundle fist me because I don't know how to play my champion. Slow = hop smaller = I get fisted in ice by aids exodia champ.
- Multiple points where I don't ult Alistar for whatever reason. Not sure why.
